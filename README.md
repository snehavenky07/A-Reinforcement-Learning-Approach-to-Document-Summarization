# A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Document Summarization

The project focused on developing an abstractive text summarization system using reinforcement learning (REINFORCE and Actor-Critic models). Traditional summarization methods often fail to generate human-like, coherent summaries. By leveraging reinforcement learning, this project optimized summary quality based on evaluation metrics like ROUGE scores. The system demonstrated significant improvements in creating concise and informative summaries for practical applications in areas like customer service, news aggregation, and business reporting.
